Title: The GASSCO method for correcting for slide-dependent gene-specific dye bias
Version: 1.40.0
Date: 2 March 2016
Author: Philip Lijnzaad and Thanasis Margaritis
Description: Many two-colour hybridizations suffer from a dye bias that is
  both gene-specific and slide-specific. The former depends on the content of
  the nucleotide used for labeling; the latter depends on the labeling
  percentage. The slide-dependency was hitherto not recognized, and made
  addressing the artefact impossible.  Given a reasonable number of
  dye-swapped pairs of hybridizations, or of same vs. same hybridizations,
  both the gene- and slide-biases can be estimated and corrected using the
  GASSCO method (Margaritis et al., Mol. Sys. Biol. 5:266 (2009),
